## About Me
Hi there, I'm James Ezeilo and I enjoy using my knowledge of coding and sports analytics to make fun and inciteful projects that aim to change the game! This tends to involve interactive dashboards, predictive models, or visualizing complex datasets.

- 🔭 I’m working on a Python web application that takes user input to rank past and present NBA players, effectively creating an estimated 'Top 100' list.
- 💬 Ask me about the project above and give me feedback or advice if possible!
- 📫 How to reach me: [jmge.work@gmail.com](mailto:jmge.work@gmail.com)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I actually used data analysis to win money in a fantasy sports league (totally legal). Also my Smash main is Kirby...in case that wasn't obvious.

## 🛠️ My Skills

- **Frameworks**: Flask
- **Tools**: Git, Docker, VS Code
